# ```json-transform```

## Zweck

The ```wk-json-transform``` package is used to transform JSON template
objects into JOSN objects. It is developed as part of the lecture
"Web Programming" by [Wolfgang L. J. Kowarschick](https://kowa.hs-augsburg.de).

## Installation

```bash
cd ...
git clone https://github.com/wljkowa/json-transform.git
```

## Verwendung

Objects of the class ```JsonTransform``` transform JSON objects
by means of the method ```transform```. Which transformers are
applied in wich ordering is determined by passing transformer
functions either to the constructor or to the method ```transform```.
In addition, an environment object can be passed to both methods.
The transformer functions can access the enviroment objects.

```bash
import { JsonTransform }        from '@wljkowa/json-transformer-transform/json.transform';
import { transformerArraySome } from '@wljkowa/json-transformer-transform/transformer/transformer.array.some'

let jsonTransform = new JsonTransform({}, [transformerArraySome]);

console.log(jsonTransform.transform(['$some', 5, 7, 9])) -> 5 or 7 or 9 (randomly)
```

See directories ```test``` and ```examples``` for more examples.
